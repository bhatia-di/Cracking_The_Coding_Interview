# Behavioral Design Patterns

## Chain of Responsibility Pattern
- The Chain of Responsibility passes requests along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

## Iterator Pattern
The iterator is used to traverse elements of a collection. This might sound trivial in programming languages used nowadays, but this wasn't always the case.
example: for each, for of, for in

## Observer Pattern
The observer pattern lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing. Basically, it's like having an event listener on a given object, and when that object performs the action we're listening for, we do something
Example: React's useEffect hook might be a good example here
